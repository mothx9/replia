# Interaction contract

This document owns behavior shared by the Rust and C interfaces. Individual
Rust methods are documented in rustdoc (`cargo doc --no-deps`); the
[C contract](c-api.md) owns ABI representation and mechanical C ownership.
[Architecture](architecture.md) explains the implementing modules.

## Text and editing boundaries

Storage and capacities are **UTF-8 bytes**. Every public cursor/range endpoint
must lie on an **extended grapheme boundary**, as determined by
`unicode-segmentation`. Left/Right, Backspace/Delete operate on those clusters.
Insertion/deletion can join adjacent clusters; the cursor advances to the next
valid boundary after the edit. Invalid ranges, controls and capacity overflow
leave the original text and cursor unchanged.

Home/End and Ctrl-A/Ctrl-E refer to the whole input, including multiple logical
lines. Up/Down navigate history, not vertical columns. Input is neither trimmed
nor normalized as Unicode. LF and TAB are accepted text; other Unicode controls
are rejected. Bracketed paste performs the separate newline normalization below.

The [presentation contract](presentation.md#prompt-cells-and-redraw) separately
defines terminal cells, ANSI width, tab expansion and emulator limits.

## Bounded input and paste

The decoder consumes one byte per poll. UTF-8 staging holds at most four bytes;
escape staging at most 64. Supported CSI/SS3 sequences cover arrows, Home/End,
Delete and bracketed-paste delimiters; listed control keys include Enter,
Ctrl-A/C/D/E/L, Backspace and Tab. Unknown sequences are rejected. Oversized CSI
or OSC sequences drain to their terminator with constant extra memory. A bad
UTF-8 byte and the incomplete scalar containing it are rejected together; the
offending byte is not replayed as a shortcut.

The adapter expires pending sequences after a 250 ms idle interval, observed
while polling. Each poll waits at most 100 ms. This is an idle bound, not a
fixed total sequence length/time guess; tests deliver each byte with a delay
longer than 25 ms. Expired UTF-8/escape input produces `Event::Rejected` and
keeps the draft. Host starvation can delay observation.

Bracketed paste stages one atomic payload, bounded by the editor byte limit,
and recognizes fragmented begin/end markers. CRLF becomes one LF; lone CR and
LF become LF. TAB remains literal text, not completion. Other control characters
reject the **entire** paste; they never execute shortcuts. Oversized payloads
are drained through their end marker, then rejected. The wire-byte bound is
applied before newline normalization, and insertion separately checks remaining
draft capacity. Invalid UTF-8 is rejected. No partial paste is committed.

An incomplete paste or physical EOF during a pending sequence produces a terminal
I/O error and closes/restores the interaction. The host must treat this as a
failed input transaction; automatically reopening on an untrusted remaining
byte stream would erase the framing distinction. Enter outside paste submits
one complete string. Unbracketed LF/CR each mean Enter; automatic detection of
unframed multi-command paste is not promised.

## Terminal and signal ownership

`Interaction::open` validates TTY input and output and requires the same terminal
before changing state. It duplicates the FDs, captures full termios and window
dimensions, enters raw mode with ISIG disabled, enables bracketed paste and draws.
No input queue is flushed. One active interaction per linked library image is admitted;
other opens fail before mutation. The small atomic lease prevents competing
editors but does not install a process-wide signal policy.

Submit, empty-buffer Ctrl-D/read EOF, interruption and explicit close restore
**exactly the captured termios**, not a guessed cooked mode. Read/write errors,
partial acquisition and ordinary unwinding also attempt restoration. Bracketed
paste is disabled and styling reset during cleanup. A failed output FD does not
skip termios restoration; cleanup also tries the same-terminal input FD when
writable. Explicit errors report cleanup failure along with the original error.
Drop is best effort and never panics or exits the process. Disconnected terminals
may reject restoration syscalls, and no library can promise cleanup on SIGKILL,
abort or process termination that bypasses unwinding.

No handlers, signal masks, signal threads or cancellation threads are installed,
so there is no previous handler state to replace or restore. Keyboard Ctrl-C is
a decoded byte yielding `Interrupted`, with a visible `^C` at the end of the
editing surface. OS SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGTSTP policy stays with the host. A host may
observe its own signals and call `interrupt` or `close`; suspension requires
closing before suspension and opening again after resumption. Resize is observed
by reading current dimensions on each poll, independent of SIGWINCH handlers;
it works even when the host owns or blocks SIGWINCH. Concurrent direct writers
or externally changing terminal modes during an interaction are unsupported.

## Host lifecycle and events

`Interaction` uses the independently owned composition described in
[architecture](architecture.md#composition-and-public-boundaries). `editor()`
exposes current text and byte cursor; `editor_mut()` permits direct host edits only while closed.
Active edits go through validated completion/output operations so display state
cannot become stale. Terminal closure does not clear the editor or admit history.
The host can retain rejected/interrupted/submitted input and choose its next step.

- `Event::Submitted(String)`: Enter; terminal restored.
- `Event::Interrupted`: decoded Ctrl-C or explicit host call; terminal restored.
- `Event::EndOfInput`: physical EOF or Ctrl-D with empty text; terminal restored.
  Ctrl-D with nonempty text deletes the next grapheme (no-op at end).
- `Event::CompletionRequested`: Tab; active draft remains available.
- `Event::Rejected(EditError)`: recoverable input/capacity failure; editing continues.
- `Error::State`: operation unavailable in the current lifecycle.
- `Error::Busy`: another interaction owns the terminal lease.
- `Error::UnsuitableTerminal`: non-TTY, terminal mismatch or unsupported dimensions.
- `Error::Edit`: invalid host edit/output text; unchanged draft, interaction active.
- `Error::Io`: terminal failure; restoration attempted, interaction unavailable
  after successful restoration. A failed restoration is reported.

## Completion

Completion has no callback registry or candidate type. The host reads text and
cursor, discovers and selects candidates, and calls `complete(range, text)` for
one chosen replacement. Range endpoints must be ordered grapheme boundaries.
Zero candidates, ambiguity, refusal or lookup failure need no mutation. The
same atomic validation applies to Unicode and oversized replacements.

## History

History is configured by entry count and input byte bound. Admission is explicit,
with oldest-entry eviction only when the host-selected bound is full. No hardcoded
history size, persistence, deduplication or privacy policy exists. First Up saves
the current draft **and cursor**; Down past the newest entry restores both.
Editing a recalled entry changes only the current edit. Navigating away discards
that recalled edit, without modifying admitted history.

## Coordinated output

The [presentation contract](presentation.md#external-output) owns visible
output transactions and their limits. Host execution may instead write after
submission closes the terminal, then reopen for the next draft. Neither path
installs an application scheduler.
